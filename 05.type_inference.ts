// Type Inference

// Type inference is a tool that the TypeScript compiler uses to infer types when there is no explicit
// information available in the form of type annotations.

// TypeScript infers types of variables when there is no explicit information available in the form of type annotations.

// For example, the following code snippet has no type annotations for the variables:

let x = 3; // Type inferred as number
let y = [0, 1, 9]; // Type inferred as number[]

// TypeScript infers the types of the variables x and y as number and number[] respectively.
